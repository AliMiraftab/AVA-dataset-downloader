## You may need these scripts to download AVA images from website.

The AVA dataset website: http://www.vabs.info/papers/AVA/\n
AVA is a large-Scale database for aesthetic visual analysis containing 25000+ photos from dpchallenge.com.\n
However, the downloaded pakage only has image list and annotations. You may need these scripts to download AVA images from website.

##Usage:
After unzip downloaded pakage, create a new folder 'scripts' under 'AVA_dataset/' and copy the scipts into this new folder. Also create 'image' under 'AVA_dataset/' to save all images.\n
Specific usage of scripts please refer to scripts themselves.\n
Please note that downloading all images may spend lots of time. 'beginIndex' and 'stopIndex' may help you perform multi-process downloading manually.\n
